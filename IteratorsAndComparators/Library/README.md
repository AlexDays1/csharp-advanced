## Library

**NOTE** : You need the namespace **IteratorsAndComparators**.

Create a class **Book** , which should have three public properties:

- **string Title**
- **int Year**
- **List\&lt;string\&gt; Authors**

Authors can be **anonymous, one or many**. A Book should have only **one**** constructor**.

Create a class **Library** , which should store a collection of books and implement the **IEnumerable\&lt;Book\&gt;** interface.

- **List\&lt;Book\&gt; books**

A Library could be intilized without books or with any number of books and should have only **one**** constructor**.
