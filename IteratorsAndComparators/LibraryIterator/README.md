## Library Iterator

**NOTE** : You need the namespace **IteratorsAndComparators**.

Extend your solution from the prevoius task. Inside the Library class create a **nested class**** LibraryIterator, **which should implement the** IEnumerator\&lt;Book\&gt;** interface. Try to implement the bodies of the inherited methods by yourself. You will need two more members:

- **List\&lt;Book\&gt; books**
- **int currentIndex**

Now you should be able to iterate through a Library in the Main method.
