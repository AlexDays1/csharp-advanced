## Applied Arithmetics

Write a program that executes some mathematical operations on a given collection. On the **first line** you are given **a list of numbers**. On the **next lines** you are passed **different commands** that you need to **apply to all numbers** in the list: &quot;add&quot; -\&gt; add 1 to each number; &quot;multiply&quot; -\&gt; multiply each number by 2; &quot;subtract&quot; -\&gt; subtract 1 from each number; &quot;print&quot; -\&gt; print the collection. The input will end with an &quot; **end**&quot; command.Use functions.
